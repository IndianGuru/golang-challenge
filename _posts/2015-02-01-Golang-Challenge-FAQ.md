**What is the Go Challenge ?**

* The Go Challenge is a monthly programming challenge for Go programmers (newbies included).
* **The Go Challenge is free and registration is not required**.
* A new Go Challenge will be posted here on the **first day of each month** starting March 2015. 
* The challenge is open to individuals only. 
* You are invited to post your queries / doubts on our [forum](https://groups.google.com/d/forum/go-challenge).

**How does the Go Challenge benefit you ?**

The Go Challenge:

* is a good idea as reading books and documentation can only take you so far when learning a new language. To really learn, you need to use the language. 
* provides a fabulous forum for using Go in the form of regular, engaging (but not arcanely difficult) challenges. Better yet, it provides feedback on how to use Go well, as each month the best solution to a challenge is chosen. 
* is a wonderful introduction to the Go language and to the Go community. 

**How to Enter the Go Challenge ?**

* Read the **Challenge Rules** located at the bottom of this page. By participating in this challenge, you agree to be bound by these Challenge Rules.
* You can enter the challenge by posting your solution details only on 14th or 15th of the month **[here](https://github.com/IndianGuru/Golang-Challenge-1)**. No new solutions will be accepted after that.
* The Go working solution(s) should be clear-cut, follow Go conventions and still be easy to understand. Refer to [Effective Go](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html) and [Go Code Review Comments](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/CodeReviewComments).
* On the 16th of the month, all the solutions will be thrown open for [everyone to see, comment upon and cast votes](https://groups.google.com/d/forum/go-challenge). 

**Best Solution**

The author of the Go Challenge for the particular month will decide the best solution, with some help from the Go community. This author shall have the sole authority and discretion to select the award recipient(s). 

**Notification**

The winning entries will be announced here. The winners will be sent their prizes by email.

**Prizes**

There will normally be two prizes (though we reserve the right to change this for each challenge). One prize will be awarded for the best solution selected by the author and a panel and the other will be for the best popular voted solution by the community. Prizes can range from small cash rewards to free PDFs, Screencasts – whatever the sponsors of the challenge have offered.

**Challenge Example**

Chris Strom had set up a [Ruby challenge](http://rubylearning.com/blog/2015/01/26/rpcfn-average-arrival-time-for-a-flight-2-reprint/) way back in 2009. We would have similar challenges for Go.
