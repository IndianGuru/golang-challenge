The second Go Challenge author is [Guillaume J. Charmes](https://twitter.com/charme_g). French first, software developer second. He loves to travel and used to live in France, China, Russia, RÃ©union, San Francisco, Chicago and Miami. He also likes to travel between technologies and languages: He jumped from C and ASM to PHP to fall into Python to then migrate to Go with some sides of Ruby. He is coming from a low-level ASM/C background which he uses to teach as well as for web security.
