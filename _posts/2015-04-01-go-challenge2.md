#### The second monthly Go Challenge for developers (newbies included)

#### Guillaume J. Charmes: Author of the second Go Challenge

<img align="right" src="/images/guillaume-j-charmes.jpg" height="200" width="200" alt="Guillaume J. Charmes" title="Guillaume J. Charmes" style="border:5px solid black" />
The second Go Challenge author is [Guillaume J. Charmes](https://twitter.com/charme_g). French first, software developer second. He loves to travel and used to live in France, China, Russia, Réunion, San Francisco, Chicago and Miami. He also likes to travel between technologies and languages: He jumped from C and ASM to PHP to fall into Python to then migrate to Go with some sides of Ruby. He is coming from a low-level ASM/C background which he uses to teach as well as for web security. 

He started using Go in 2009 and fell in love with its syntax and concurrency model. He joined dotCloud, Inc. where he was the only Go developer for a while. This is when they started Docker..., in Go. Arrived to Docker 1.0, he moved on to Citrix, Inc. under the sun of Florida where he helps the moving process from Ruby to Go.

Guillaume has this to say about the challenge:

> "Data security is a very important matter and this challenge is a good way to dive in with the `NaCl` package and leverage the power of Go interfaces to implement a clean solution over the network."

#### The Go Challenge 2

##### Can you help me secure my company’s data transmission?

Last week, our competitor released a feature that we were working on in secret. We suspect that they are spying on our network. Can you help us prevent our competitor from spying on our network?

By participating in this challenge, you agree to be bound by the Challenge Rules below:

* The Challenge is open to individuals.
* Evaluators cannot enter the challenge except under the "Just for Fun" category.
* Each entrant shall indemnify, defend, and hold JoshSoftware Pvt. Ltd. (who has sponsored the domain and is the organizer of these challenges) harmless from any third party claims arising from or related to that entrant's participation in the Challenge. In no event shall JoshSoftware Pvt. Ltd. be liable to an entrant for acts or omissions arising out of or related to the Challenge or that entrant's participation in the Challenge.
* Odds of winning depend on the number and quality of entries received. 
* All taxes, including income taxes, are the sole responsibility of the winners. 
* No prize substitution is permitted. 
* Create a zip of your Go source code and send the zip file to **golangchallenge [at] gmail.com before 18th of April 2015 (6 am IST). Use [this link](http://www.worldtimeserver.com/convert_time_in_IN.aspx?y=2015&mo=4&d=18&h=6&mn=0) to find the equivalent time in your city/country**. No new solutions will be accepted after that. In the email mention **your full name, country of residence, twitter or GitHub id (if any) and participating under which category - Just participating | Participating and adding more steps | Just for Fun | Anonymous entry**. We are accepting anonymous submissions and will evaluate them too but then these participants are not eligible for the prizes. 
* We will give your zip file to the evaluation team. 
* We shall be publishing on this blog, a list of participant names. If you don't want your name to appear kindly mention the same in your email. 
* You are allowed to re-submit your code if you feel it's necessary.
* **Note**: Avoid sharing your code with anyone else; if your solution becomes available to the general public it might impact evaluation of your submission.
* After the challenge is over, all submissions will be made available [online on GitHub](https://github.com/golangchallenge/GCSolutions) under the [BSD 3-Clause License](http://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause) unless a participant has indicated that his/her solution should not be made public before the challenge ends.

#### How will the challenge be evaluated?

Entries will be anonymized and evaluated by the challenge author and a team of evaluators.

* Functioning code and a test suite that passes.
* Code hygiene. Use [gofmt](https://golang.org/cmd/gofmt/), [vet](https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/tools/cmd/vet) and [lint](https://github.com/golang/lint). Review [CodeReviewComments](https://code.google.com/p/go-wiki/wiki/CodeReviewComments).
* Readability. How easy is it for another programmer to grasp what your entry is doing?
* Code structure. Do types and files have good names?
* Reliability. Are errors properly handled?
* Appropriate consideration given to memory and performance (nothing is unnecessarily expensive).

#### Questions?

If you have any questions about this challenge, please join the [golang-challenge channel on slack](http://t.co/n6EesY9Mmv) and ask your questions. This is a room for people who are going to participate in the Go Challenge. You can also send us an email at golangchallenge [at] gmail.com
