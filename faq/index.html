<h3>Who has started the Go Challenge ?</h3>
<p><img align="right" src="http://rubylearning.com/images/go-challenge.png" alt="Go Challenge" title="http://golang-challenge.com/" /><a href="http://www.joshsoftware.com/" target="_blank">JoshSoftware Pvt. Ltd.</a> is India's leading company in building innovative web applications working exclusively in Ruby On Rails since 2007. Josh have been using Go in some of their Web applications along side Rails (especially for some heavy lifting). Back in 2009, Josh had been actively involved in organizing Ruby programming challenges and decided that Go too needs such challenges. Hence the monthly Go Challenge.</p>

<h3>What is the Go Challenge ?</h3>

<ul>
    <li>The Go Challenge is the world's first monthly programming challenge for Go developers (newbies included).</li>
    <li><b>The Go Challenge is free and registration is not required.</b></li>
    <li>A new Go Challenge will be posted here on the <b>first day of each month</b> starting March 2015.</li>

    <li>You are invited to post your queries / doubts on our <b><a href="https://groups.google.com/d/forum/go-challenge)" target="_blank">forum</a></b>.</li>
</ul>

<h3>How does the Go Challenge benefit you ?</h3>

<p>The Go Challenge:</p>
<ul>
	<li>is a good idea as reading books and documentation can only take you so far when learning a new language. To really learn, you need to use the language.</li>
	<li>provides a fabulous forum for using Go in the form of regular, engaging (but not arcanely difficult) challenges. Better yet, it provides feedback on how to use Go well, as each month the best solution to a challenge is chosen.</li>
	<li>is a wonderful introduction to the Go language and to the Go community.</li>
</ul>
