<h3>Who has started the Go Challenge ?</h3>
<p><img align="right" src="http://rubylearning.com/images/go-challenge.png" alt="Go Challenge" title="http://golang-challenge.com/" /><a href="http://www.joshsoftware.com/" target="_blank">JoshSoftware Pvt. Ltd.</a> is India's leading company in building innovative web applications working exclusively in Ruby On Rails since 2007. Josh have been using Go in some of their Web applications along side Rails (especially for some heavy lifting). Back in 2009, Josh had been actively involved in organizing Ruby programming challenges and decided that Go too needs such challenges. Hence the monthly Go Challenge.</p>

<h3>What is the Go Challenge ?</h3>

<ul>
    <li>The Go Challenge is the world's first monthly programming challenge for Go developers (newbies included).</li>
    <li><b>The Go Challenge is free and registration is not required.</b></li>
    <li>A new Go Challenge will be posted here on the <b>first day of each month</b> starting March 2015.</li>
    <li>The challenge is open to individuals only.</li>
    <li>You are invited to post your queries / doubts on our <b><a href="https://groups.google.com/d/forum/go-challenge" target="_blank">forum</a></b>.</li>
</ul>

<h3>How does the Go Challenge benefit you ?</h3>

<p>The Go Challenge:</p>
<ul>
	<li>is a good idea as reading books and documentation can only take you so far when learning a new language. To really learn, you need to use the language.</li>
	<li>provides a fabulous forum for using Go in the form of regular, engaging (but not arcanely difficult) challenges. Better yet, it provides feedback on how to use Go well, as each month the best solution to a challenge is chosen.</li>
	<li>is a wonderful introduction to the Go language and to the Go community.</li>
</ul>

<h3>How to Enter the Go Challenge ?</h3>

<ul>
	<li>Read the <b>Challenge Rules</b> below. By participating in this challenge, you agree to be bound by the Challenge Rules.</li>
	<li>Create a zip of your Go source code and send the zip file to <b>gochallenge [at] joshsoftware.com before the 12th of the month</b>. No new solutions will be accepted after that. In the email mention <b>your full name, country of residence, and twitter id</b>. We will give your zip file to the evaluation team. <b>Note</b>: Avoid sharing your code with anyone else; if your solution becomes available to the general public it might impact evaluation of your submission.</li>
        <li>On the 13th of the month at <a href="http://www.worldtimeserver.com/convert_time_in_IN.aspx?y=2015&amp;mo=3&amp;d=16&amp;h=6&amp;mn=0" target="_blank">6 am IST</a>, all the solutions will be thrown open for <a href="https://groups.google.com/d/forum/go-challenge" target="_blank">everyone to see and comment upon</a>.</li>
 </ul>

<h3>How will the challenge be evaluated?</h3>

<p>Entries will be anonymized and evaluated by the challenge author and a team of evaluators.</p>
<ul>
<li>Functioning code and a test suite that passes.</li>	
<li>Code hygiene. Use <a href="https://golang.org/cmd/gofmt/" target="_blank">gofmt</a>, <a href="https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/tools/cmd/vet" target="_blank">vet</a> and <a href="https://github.com/golang/lint" target="_blank">lint</a>. Review <a href="https://code.google.com/p/go-wiki/wiki/CodeReviewComments" target="_blank">CodeReviewComments</a>.</li>	
<li>Readability. How easy is it for another programmer to grasp what your entry is doing?</li>	
<li>Code structure. Do types and files have good names?</li>	
<li>Reliability. Are errors handled?</li>	
<li>Appropriate consideration given to memory and performance (nothing is unnecessarily expensive).</li>	
</ul>
